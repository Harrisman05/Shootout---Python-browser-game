# Shootout---Python-browser-game

## A browser game created using the Python package Pygame. This game uses gifs to simulate a penalty shootout

This was the first coding project I ever created, and was inspired from my father's version of the game. He created the assets 
and created the first iteration of the game in Whatsapp. This was to help pass time over lockdown. I decided to collect all the
assets and bundle them into a .exe file for a user to run on their browser!

## How to download and play Shootout

* Download the master repository as ZIP
* Extract all files - all assets and dependancies must be present in the extracted folder and not deleted
* Launch the <b>!-Shootout-!.exe</b> file to start the game (Python installation not required)
* :warning::warning::warning: Firewalls can incorrectly detect the executible file as a virus, preventing you from running the executible. Add the executible as an exception or select the "run anyways" option if you get a pop-up
